Learning how to make commits and staging files for cloning them to the remote 
repository on GitHub.
This is followed by a series of Git commands also known as Git workflow.
I am so excited to gain this new skill since it sharpens my understanding
on how useful Git is and makes me get handy with it 
as I progress to the top of my career path!

Day 02 deeper into the HTML and CSS basics and I'm getting even more excited!!!!!
